## Performativ Frontend Engineer Trial Project

**Estimated Effort:** 10-20 hours

Given the following high-level description of functionality, this project involves designing and building a UI prototype for a new user journey within an existing application. The goal is to capture data necessary for building a house successfully:

1. **What type of foundation?**
   - Options: brick, slab, reinforced concrete

2. **What size?**

3. **How many floors?**

4. **Room Specification:**
   - For each floor, the questionnaire should include:
     - Size of the room in square meters
     - Type of room (e.g., bedroom, lounge, diner, kitchen, bathroom, office)
     - Floor type: wood/carpet
     - Number of windows in the room
     - Details for each window:
       - Selection from predefined window types or the ability to add a new type dynamically
       - Window type properties: Style (Bay/Flat/Full Height), Glass Type (tempered, triple glazed, double glazed)
     - Each room type may have specific properties (e.g., office has desk/chair, kitchen has white goods list)

**Requirements:**
- Use functional React components
- Utilize Storybook or create a full app with routing as a container
- Component library usage is optional

The prototype can use dummy backend data to showcase the user journey for house construction. Ensure the design and wireframes encapsulate a smooth UX/UI experience.
